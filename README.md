# Eventdisplay - An Analysis and Reconstruction Package for Ground-based Gamma-ray Astronomy

Eventdisplay is a reconstruction and analysis pipline for data of
Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT).
It has been primarily developed for VERITAS and CTA analysis and used in
many VERITAS and CTA publications. 
This repository contains the Eventdisplay version used for CTA and other analyses.

The package consist of several repository:
- [Eventdisplay](https://github.com/Eventdisplay/Eventdisplay): the main analysis and reconstruction code.
- [Analysis files](https://github.com/Eventdisplay/Eventdisplay_AnalysisFiles_CTA) and [analysis scripts](https://github.com/Eventdisplay/Eventdisplay_AnalysisScripts_CTA) for the analysis of [CTAO](https://www.cta-observatory.org/) simulations.
- [Converter](https://github.com/Eventdisplay/Converters) scripts to convert Eventdisplay output to FITS format.
