## Eventdisplay - An Analysis and Reconstruction Package for Ground-based Gamma-ray Astronomy

Eventdisplay is a reconstruction and analysis pipeline for data of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT). 
It has been primarily developed for [VERITAS](veritas.sao.arizona.edu/) and [CTA](https://cta-observatory.org/) analysis and used in many VERITAS and CTA publications.

This organisation contains the Eventdisplay versions used for CTA and other analyses. 
For those used in VERITAS, please go to https://github.com/VERITAS-Observatory/EventDisplay_v4
